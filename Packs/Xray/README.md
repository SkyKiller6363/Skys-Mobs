## Included Items

This pack comes pre-configured with **5 distinct items**:

### Xray Items (Ore Finder)
- **Short Range (10 blocks)**: Temporarily replaces blocks in front of the player with glass, clearly highlighting ores for quick identification.  
- **Long Range (20 blocks)**: Extended visibility range, perfect for deeper mining sessions.

### Cave Finder Items
- **Short Range (20 blocks)**: Temporarily transforms blocks in front into transparent glass, allowing players to quickly locate nearby caves and structures.
- **Long Range (40 blocks)**: Greater visibility for extensive cave exploration.

### Admin Xray Item
- Special admin-only item providing extensive visibility for administrative or moderation purposes. Ideal for inspecting player activity or reviewing terrain structures.

## How It Works

When an Xray or Cave Finder item is activated, blocks in front of the player turn into transparent glass for clear visibility:

- **Xray items**: Ores are additionally highlighted with a glowing effect.
- **Cave Finder items**: Does not highlight ores, focusing purely on cave detection.

After a few seconds, all blocks revert to their original state automatically, ensuring minimal disruption to normal gameplay.
