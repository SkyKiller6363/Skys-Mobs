## Overview

The **Zombie Hoard Pack** brings a chaotic, storm-fueled invasion to your Minecraft world. Featuring **7 new custom zombies**, this pack introduces new threats, from a **mace-wielding brute** to a **dark voodoo mage** capable of summoning destruction.

When thunderstorms rage, beware — a **Banner-Wielding Zombie** may spawn on the surface. Once approached or attacked, it will **summon an entire zombie hoard** to swarm the player. If not slain quickly, it can **re-summon reinforcements**, turning a small skirmish into an all-out siege.

This pack is designed to blend seamlessly into survival gameplay, making thunderstorms a truly terrifying experience.
