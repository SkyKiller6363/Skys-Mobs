# Thief Mob Pack

**Requirements**

* ✅ **MythicMobs** free 5.10.1+
* ✅ **LibsDisguises** free (latest version)

---

## Overview

The **Thief** is a mischievous mob designed to cause chaos and panic. Instead of simply attacking, this mob will **steal the item out of your hand** and flee. Defeating it rewards you with a high chance of retrieving your stolen gear, making encounters both risky and rewarding.

This pack is intentionally lightweight — perfect as a plug-and-play addition to your server.
