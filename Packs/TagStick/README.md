# Tag Stick

**Overview**  
The Tag Stick Pack provides a fun, fast-paced multiplayer twist on the classic "Cheese Touch" concept. It’s easy to set up and perfect for lively gaming sessions with friends.

This pack includes:
- **1 Tag Stick** item  
- **4 Tag Skills**

**Key Features**  
- Expandable skill set with clear comments in `tagstick-skills.yml` for easy customization  
- Familiar "tag" mechanic that fosters dynamic, unpredictable gameplay  
- Flexible setup that can be adapted to various game modes

**How It Works**  
Loosely inspired by the "Cheese Touch" game, the Tag Stick Pack ensures that once you’ve been tagged, you’re stuck holding the stick until you tag another player!

**Getting Started**  
1. Download and install the Tag Stick Pack files (See Installation Instructions Above).  
2. Review the comments in the `tagstick-skills.yml` file to see how to add or modify skills.  
3. Launch your game and enjoy a fun, fast-paced round of Tag!
